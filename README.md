### What Job It Out is not? 

It is not a ~~job search website~~ to post jobs & hire people, for that there are many better alternatives available like Google jobs, LinkedIn, Indeed and many more.

### Then what it is basically?
1. Its a social platform connecting with the right person.

2. One can register to **share the job/internship opportunities**, they find the best in these job searching websites.

4. Users can share the **job experiences ,great insights, mistakes they made** while applying to any firms or solve any fellow student query regarding that.
